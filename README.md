# FINAL-PROJECT-Silent-Pandemic

## Project Overview

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicine.This poses a significant threat to public health worldwide, complicating the management of infectious diseases. 
In agriculture, the use of antibiotics in livestock farming contributes to the emergence of resistant bacteria, which can enter the human food chain through contaminated meat products.

  Understanding this link is crucial for addressing AMR. 
Efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, promote responsible antimicrobial stewardship, and improve food safety are essential for mitigating the spread of resistance and preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobial drugs. 
Collaboration between healthcare professionals, veterinarians, policymakers, researchers, and consumers is key to implementing effective interventions and protecting public health.


## Importance of the Project

- **Addressing a Public Health Issue:** This project tackles the urgent challenge of antibiotic resistance, which is crucial for effective medical treatments.

- **Impact on Food Security:** It examines the critical link between antibiotic use in animal production and bacterial resistance, vital for food chain safety.

- **Promoting Awareness and Action:** By raising awareness, it empowers action towards responsible antibiotic use and infection prevention.

- **Applications in Decision Making:** Its analysis informs policy-making, guiding strategies for managing antibiotic resistance and promoting sustainable agriculture.

- **Contribution to Scientific Knowledge:** Through research, it contributes to the understanding of antibiotic resistance and infectious disease epidemiology, aiding future prevention and control efforts.

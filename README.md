Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicine.This poses a significant threat to public health worldwide, complicating the management of infectious diseases. 
In agriculture, the use of antibiotics in livestock farming contributes to the emergence of resistant bacteria, which can enter the human food chain through contaminated meat products.

  Understanding this link is crucial for addressing AMR. 
Efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, promote responsible antimicrobial stewardship, and improve food safety are essential for mitigating the spread of resistance and preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobial drugs. 
Collaboration between healthcare professionals, veterinarians, policymakers, researchers, and consumers is key to implementing effective interventions and protecting public health.
